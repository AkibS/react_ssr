# What is server side rendering?
The most common use case for server-side rendering is to handle the initial render when a user (or search engine crawler) first requests our app. When the server receives the request, it renders the required component(s) into an HTML string, and then sends it as a response to the client

# Whatâ€™s the difference between client-side rendering and server-side rendering?

In Client-side rendering, your browser downloads a minimal HTML page. It renders the JavaScript and fills the content into it.

Server-side rendering, on the other hand, renders the React components on the server. The output is HTML content.

You can combine these two to create an isomorphic app.
